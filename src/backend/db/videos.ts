    An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
    The length of an array is established when the array is created.
    After creation, its length is fixed.
    Each item in an array is called an element, and each element is accessed by its numerical index.
    numbering begins with 0.
    
    Linked list is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
    Instead, each element points to the next.
    It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.
    Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence.
    This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration.`,

In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree and sometimes radix tree or prefix tree (as they can be searched by prefixes), is a kind of search tree—an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string. Values are not necessarily associated with every node. Rather, values tend only to be associated with leaves, and with some inner nodes that correspond to keys of interest. For the space-optimized presentation of prefix tree, see compact prefix tree.`,

    about: `An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

    Time-sharing #operating_systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.
    
    Operating system Full Course: https://youtu.be/mXw9ruZaxzQ
    
    For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer – from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.`,

    about: `In this deadlock in OS video tutorial, we will understand what is a deadlock in Operating systems, what are the conditions that result in deadlocks & strategies for handling deadlocks.

    Deadlocks in OS -
    A process in operating systems uses different resources and uses resources in following way.
    1) Requests a resource
    2) Use the resource
    2) Releases the resource
    Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process.
    
    Deadlock can arise if following four conditions hold simultaneously (Necessary Conditions) -
    1) Mutual Exclusion: One or more than one resource are non-sharable (Only one process can use at a time)
    2) Hold and Wait: A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for resources.
    3) No Preemption: A resource cannot be taken from a process unless the process releases the resource.
    4) Circular Wait: A set of processes are waiting for each other in circular form.
    
    Methods for handling deadlock -
    There are three ways to handle deadlock
    1) Deadlock prevention or avoidance - The idea is to not let the system into deadlock state.
    2) Deadlock detection and recovery - Let deadlock occur, then do preemption to handle it once occurred.
    3) Ignore the problem all together - If deadlock is very rare, then let it happen and reboot the system. This is the approach that both Windows and UNIX take.

    about: ` Paging Definition -
    1. In computer operating systems, paging is a memory management scheme by which a computer stores and retrieves data from secondary storage for use in main memory. 
    2. In this scheme, the operating system retrieves data from secondary storage in same-size blocks called pages. 
    Paging is an important part of virtual memory implementations in modern operating systems, using secondary storage to let programs exceed the size of available physical memory.
    3. Non-contiguous memory allocation
    4. Helps prevent external fragmentation
    5. Logical address space is divided into equal size pages
    6. physical address space is divided into equal size frames
    7. Page Size = Frame Size
    
    A. Logical Address or Virtual Address (represented in bits): An address generated by the CPU
    B. Logical Address Space or Virtual Address Space( represented in words or bytes): The set of all logical addresses generated by a program
    C. Physical Address (represented in bits): An address actually available on memory unit
    D. Physical Address Space (represented in words or bytes): The set of all physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses
